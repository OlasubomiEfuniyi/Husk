<h1>Husk</h1>
<p>This repository was created for a shell called Husk. It functions like a regular shell. In particular, it processes both UNIX and SHELL commands and is capable of handling background processing.</p>

<div>
  <h1>Features</h1>
  <p>The features that husk will initially support include:
    <ul>
      <li>Piping</li>
      <li>Input and Output redirecion</li>
      <li>Conjunction(&&) and Disjunction(||)</li>  
      <li>Subshell</li>
      <li>Popular Shell Commands (more will be added on a rolling basis)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>As with shell commands, the functionality supported by Husk will continue to be improved and new features will be added        after the initial version of Husk is made available.</p>
